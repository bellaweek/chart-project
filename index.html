    <!-- STORY STARTS HERE -->
    <p>The first time Timothy Brovakos was found to have committed misconduct was for an unlawful vehicle search he carried out as a sergeant. The NYPD required him to undergo training as a result. He was later promoted to lieutenant and went on to commit an additional 59 acts of misconduct, including unlawful arrests, frisks, and property seizures, before the NYPD promoted him again to captain. In almost all cases where race was recorded, Brovakos targeted Black New Yorkers.</p>

    <p>Brovakos’ career reflects a broader pattern within the department. An analysis of 25 years of data from the NYC Civilian Complaint Review Board shows the NYPD routinely promotes officers with extensive histories of misconduct into supervisory and command positions.</p>

    <p>The CCRB investigates allegations such as excessive force and abuse of authority against the public. Since 2000, it has substantiated over 14,500 complaints. Of the roughly 95,000 officers who served during that time, about one in ten has at least one substantiated complaint. Misconduct is far more common among senior ranks: roughly seven out of ten high-ranking officers have at least one substantiated complaint. On average, chiefs and other top officials are seven times more likely than rank-and-file officers to have committed three or more substantiated incidents of misconduct.</p>

    <p>Longer tenure partly explains higher numbers among senior ranks. However, the pattern across the hierarchy suggests repeated violations rarely impede promotion.</p>

    <p>The NYPD did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Current <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/dcas/downloads/pdf/noes/20222558000.pdf"target="_blank">promotion guidelines for captains</a> make no mention of misconduct.</p>
 
    <p>The Police Benevolent Association, which represents rank-and-file officers, wants to ensure officer misconduct continues not to factor into promotion decisions. “Part of the pushback we are demanding from the NYPD includes not holding up promotions based on CCRB complaints,” said PBA spokesperson John Nuthall.</p>
